## Installation & Usage

To run this project, follow the steps:
```bash
npm install react react-dom react-leaflet socket.io-client
```

```bash
npm install express socket.io
```

```bash
node server.js
```

- Once the server is running, access the application in your browser:
	Default URL: http://localhost:5000 

## Map API Integration

This project uses the Maps Javascript API, Directions API, Geolocation API to provide interactive map features. The API allows users to view and interact with maps, get directions, and track locations in real time. It has been integrated into the application to display maps with customizable markers and geolocation capabilities.

## Setup Instructions
1. Obtain an API key from Google Cloud Console.
2. Add the API key to your environment variables or configuration file as follows:
```bash
   MAP_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```


## Idea 1 : SignatureStyling

### Problem:
Today, drivers increasingly seek vehicles that cater to their unique needs, including accessibility, safety, and personalization. However, traditional vehicles fail to offer inclusive features like adaptive controls, ramps, and pet safety options. Additionally, limited customization options for exterior design restrict drivers' ability to express their personal style.

### Solution:
To address these challenges, we aim to leverage innovative vehicle modification technologies to create a safer, more inclusive, and personalized driving experience in the following ways:

1.**Exterior Customization:** Advanced color modification technology, including digital wraps and innovative paints, will allow users to express their style through personalized vehicle designs.

2.**Accessibility Enhancements:** We propose implementing features like swivel seats, hand controls, and ramps to support individuals with physical challenges, making vehicles more inclusive and easy to use.

3.**Pet Safety Features:** By incorporating net barriers and pet seatbelts, we aim to ensure secure and distraction-free travel for pet owners.

These solutions collectively transform vehicles into adaptable, secure, and highly personalized spaces tailored to diverse user needs.

## Idea 2 : CareDrive

### Problem:
With rising awareness of health and safety, drivers are looking for systems that monitor their well-being on the road. Traditional vehicles lack the ability to track vital signs, detect health anomalies, or provide immediate alerts in emergencies, leaving drivers vulnerable to sudden health issues.

### Solution:
To address these challenges, we leverage advanced sensor technologies and real-time data processing to enhance driver safety and well-being in the following ways:  

1. **Health Monitoring:** Sensors embedded in seatbelts and steering wheels, including the Glucometer Chip (blood glucose monitoring), Texas Instruments AFE4404 (heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure), and Shimmer3 EDA Sensor (stress detection), track vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and stress levels in real time.
   
2. **Anomaly Detection Alerts:** Drivers receive instant notifications if health metrics deviate from safe ranges, enabling proactive responses to potential health risks.  

3. **SOS Emergency System:** A dedicated emergency button sends real-time health updates and location information to emergency contacts, ensuring timely assistance during critical situations.  

These state-of-the-art sensors deliver precise health monitoring and enable rapid interventions, prioritizing safety and promoting a secure driving experience.

## VoyageSync

### Problem:
As group travel becomes more popular, drivers struggle with coordinating journeys and staying connected on the road. Traditional vehicles rely on external devices, making it difficult to sync maps, share updates, or plan breaks in real time, resulting in disjointed and inefficient travel experiences.

### Solution:
To address these challenges, we aim to leverage vehicle-to-vehicle communication and integrated technologies to create a more connected and collaborative travel experience in the following ways:

1. **Real-Time Syncing:** We propose enabling vehicles to securely connect and sync maps, music playlists, and messages directly through their systems, eliminating the need for external devices.

2. **Break Coordination:** Drivers can coordinate rest stops and breaks seamlessly with connected travelers using intuitive in-car prompts.

3. **Shared Travel Experience:** Vehicles can share real-time journey updates, enhancing group travel and fostering collaboration.

These solutions ensure a safer, more enjoyable, and connected driving experience, eliminating distractions and improving group coordination.
